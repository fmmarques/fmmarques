# About me
I'm a SWE hailing from Portugal. If you came across this repo, you're either a
very diligent recruiter :mag: or kindred geek spirit :computer:. 

I'm happy to make your acquaitance either way :), however this is a personal
space, where I warehouse some projects and useful (for me) stuff, and it is 
always in flux (always changing).

## Where to start

I'm still filling out GitHub from older hosting platforms. If you're still 
interested in seeing some of my work, I can help you out fellow recruiter: 

### How to navigate ?

I have a big count of repos. Mostly forked, and actually untouched. They 
were forked for learning purposes, or because I found the original repo to be
a 'snow-flake'. 

My repos are those pinned. Let's start there:

- Python
    1. [portfolio](https://github.com/fmmarques/portfolio) -- this is a personal
    portfolio tracker which I'm fleshing out in my spare time. It is very in an
    early stage, but the idea is to capture most of the decision-making process
    of investing and building a consi√©rge of sorts for the average person.

    2. [offsec](https://github.com/fmmarques/offsec) -- this project is about 
    cyber security. Security is a field which interests me, so I've forked 
    many interesting repos of the field for further study. This repo, in 
    particular offers common ways to get a reverse shell, and it's useful in
    CTF challenges, which I do from time to time.

- C++ 
    1. [YAGE](https://github.com/fmmarques/yage) -- Yet Another Game Engine. 
    It's a simple project, a toyish lib, for making 2d cross platform games. 
    It's built upon SDL2 and most of the code is C++14. 
  
    When I wrote it, I did it with extensibility in mind, so I 
    took full advantage (and actually abused a little) of CMake for project
    setup and GoogleTests for unit testing. It's fun, try it out!
    
    2. [space_nomad](https://github.com/fmmarques/space_nomad) -- This is an
    attempt at an indie game, developed using YAGE. The idea is currently 
    paused, due to a non-compete clause.
    
    3. [developer_helper](https://github.com/fmmarques/developer_helper) -- this is
    a project for Win32 developers. I find that many people struggle with Win32,
    and I tried to offer an easier interface. This was used (partially) in 
    products. It's meant as an include-like lib, quite like boost in a way.
    If you venture into it, keep in mind most of the implementation is actually in
    "common", to be easy to import into projects.

    4. [c-multithreaded-queue](https://github.com/fmmarques/c-multithreaded-queue) --
    This is a synchronized queue that can be waited on by consumers, and writen to
    by producers. It's similar to Java's BlockingQueue.

- Others
    1. [sysadmin-utils](https://github.com/fmmarques/sysadmin-utils) -- I used 
    to keep a lot of servers, so I wrote a couple of scripts to ease my 
    day-to-day. Come in handy from time to time.

    2. [cook](https://github.com/fmmarques/cook) -- A repository that I created 
    to teach a friend about git. Now we'll be filling it with recipes to share 
    with family and friends. In git. Why the hell not?!

### Navigation out of the way! What else?

I've recently found that I like to do some challenges online. So, from time to 
time, I load up some LeetCode or HackerRank and do a challenge or a cert.
Here's some data about that, if that is something you care about.
